# Manual Test Guide - User Name Display and Story Creation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Name Display Issue

**Problem**: Logged-in accounts showed "Admin" or "Editor" instead of actual user names
**Root Cause**: Database returns `full_name` (with underscore) but frontend expected `fullName` (camelCase)
**Fix Applied**:

- Convert `full_name` to `fullName` in Login.js for frontend consistency
- Add fallback checks for both field names in all components

### 2. Story Saving Issue

**Problem**: Editors couldn't save stories
**Root Cause**: Story creation was trying to use `currentUser.fullName` but user data had `full_name`
**Fix Applied**: Use both field names as fallback in story creation components

## Test Steps

### Test 1: User Name Display

1. **Start the application**: `npm start`
2. **Login as Admin**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
3. **Verify Admin Name Display**:

   - Check the top-right user dropdown in the admin panel
   - Should show "Admin User" instead of just "Admin"
   - Avatar should show "A" (first letter of "Admin User")

4. **Login as Editor**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Username: `editor1`
   - Password: `editor123`
   - Should redirect to `/editor/dashboard`
5. **Verify Editor Name Display**:
   - Check the top-right user dropdown in the editor panel
   - Should show "John Editor" instead of just "Editor"
   - Avatar should show "J" (first letter of "John Editor")

### Test 2: Story Creation

1. **Login as Editor** (if not already logged in)
2. **Create a New Story**:
   - Go to `/editor/stories/new`
   - Fill in the story form:
     - Title: "Test Story - User Name Fix"
     - Excerpt: "Testing the user name display fix"
     - Content: "This story tests that the author name displays correctly."
     - Category: "Test"
     - Location: "Test Location"
     - Read Time: "2 min"
     - Tags: "test, fix, verification"
   - Upload an image (optional)
   - Click "Publish Story"
3. **Verify Story Creation**:

   - Should show success message
   - Should redirect to editor dashboard
   - Story should appear in "My Stories" section

4. **Check Story Author**:
   - Go to `/editor/stories` (My Stories)
   - Verify the story shows "John Editor" as the author
   - Not "Unknown Author" or "Editor"

### Test 3: Story Management

1. **View Drafts**:

   - Go to `/editor/drafts`
   - Should load without errors
   - Should show user's draft stories

2. **View My Stories**:
   - Go to `/editor/stories`
   - Should load without errors
   - Should show user's published stories
